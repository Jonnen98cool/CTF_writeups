## Thought Process
Tried some methods:
- `binwalk`
- `strings`
- check spectrogram with `audacity`
- watch video and look/listen for hidden clues


## Solution
After having thrown everything I got at the file, I decided to look up "mp4 steganography" and found a tool called `videostego`.
After that it was as simple as `videostego -f *video* -r`.
